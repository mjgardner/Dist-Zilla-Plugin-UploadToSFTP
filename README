NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToSFTP - Upload tarball to my own site

VERSION
    version 0.001

DESCRIPTION
        ; in dzil.ini
        [UploadToSFTP]
        site        = sftp.geocities.invalid
        directory   = /Heartland/Meadows/3044

        # in $HOME/.netrc
        machine sftp.geocities.invalid login mjgardner password drowssap

    This is a Dist::Zilla::Role::Releaser plugin that uploads a distribution
    tarball to an SFTP site. It can be used in addition to
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN or in its place. In fact I wrote it
    for the latter case so that I could release proprietary distributions
    inhouse.

  .netrc file
    The .netrc file is described in Net::Netrc and should have an entry in
    it matching the site given in the dzil.ini file and specifying the
    username and password.

ATTRIBUTES
  site
    The SFTP site to upload to.

  directory
    The directory on the SFTP site to upload the tarball to.

  debug
    Tells "ssh" to run in verbose mode. Defaults to 0.

METHODS
  release
    Uploads the tarball to the specified site and directory.
