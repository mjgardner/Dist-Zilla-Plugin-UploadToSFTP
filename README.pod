Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToSFTP - Upload tarball to my own site

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    ; in dzil.ini
    [UploadToSFTP]
    site        = sftp.geocities.invalid
    directory   = /Heartland/Meadows/3044
    debug       = 0

    # in $HOME/.netrc
    machine sftp.geocities.invalid login mjgardner password drowssap

This is a L<Dist::Zilla::Role::Releaser|Dist::Zilla::Role::Releaser> plugin that
uploads a distribution tarball to an SFTP site.  It can be used in addition to
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN|Dist::Zilla::Plugin::UploadToCPAN>
or in its place. In fact I wrote it for the latter case so that I could release
proprietary distributions inhouse.

=head2 F<.netrc> file

The F<.netrc> file is described in L<Net::Netrc|Net::Netrc> and should have an
entry in it matching the site given in the F<dzil.ini> file and specifying
the username and password.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 site

The SFTP site to upload to.

=head2 directory

The directory on the SFTP site to upload the tarball to.

=head2 debug

Tells C<ssh> to run in verbose mode.  Defaults to C<0>.
